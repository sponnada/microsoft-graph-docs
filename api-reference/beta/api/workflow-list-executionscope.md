# List executionScope of a workflow (in Lifecycle Workflows)

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Lists the users who are in the scope of the execution conditions of a [workflow](../resources/identitygovernance-workflow.md). Users who initially fall in the scope of the execution conditions, but are updated to no longer meet the conditions after it's scheduled to run, will remain on the list for a short period of time before being removed. If the execution scope is changed, users who initially met it's conditions, but no longer do so will be cleared from the list after a short period of time. New users who meet the conditions for the workflow will then be listed.

This API call requires workflow scheduling to be enabled.
